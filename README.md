   ```
   dataset/
   ├── train/
   │   ├── Acne and Rosacea Photos/
   │   ├── Atopic Dermatitis Photos/
   │   └── ... (23 disease categories)
   └── test/
       ├── Acne and Rosacea Photos/

       └── ... (23 disease categories)
   ```
4. **Download model**:
      Download model from this link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5wwmx63gw24afr15hxhid/skin_disease_model.h5?rlkey=we18mf6adx26eeh6hkmqss4a6&st=c1o0j81k&dl=1

## 🎯 Usage

### 1. Training the Model

Train the model using your dataset:

```bash
python skin_disease_model.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the training data
- Build a ResNet50V2-based model with transfer learning
- Train the model with data augmentation
- Evaluate on test data
- Save the trained model as `skin_disease_model.h5`
- Generate training history and confusion matrix plots

### 2. Web Application

Launch the Streamlit web application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Features:
- **Home**: Overview and information about the system
- **Upload & Predict**: Upload images and get instant predictions
- **Model Information**: Technical details about the model
- **About**: Information about the application

### 3. Command Line Testing

Test individual images or directories:

```bash
# Test a single image
python test_image.py --image path/to/image.jpg

# Test all images in a directory
python test_image.py --dir path/to/image/directory

# Use a specific model file
python test_image.py --image path/to/image.jpg --model my_model.h5
```

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

### Base Model
- **ResNet50V2**: Pre-trained on ImageNet
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages pre-trained weights for better performance

### Custom Layers
```
ResNet50V2 (base)
├── Global Average Pooling
├── Dropout (0.5)
├── Dense (512, ReLU)
├── Dropout (0.3)
├── Dense (256, ReLU)
├── Dropout (0.2)
└── Dense (23, Softmax)
```

### Training Strategy
- **Two-phase training**: Feature extraction + Fine-tuning
- **Data augmentation**: Rotation, shift, shear, zoom, flip
- **Regularization**: Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- **Callbacks**: Early stopping, learning rate reduction, model checkpointing

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Medical Disclaimer
- **This tool is for educational purposes only**
- **Not a replacement for professional medical advice**
- **Always consult healthcare professionals for diagnosis**
- **Results should be validated by medical experts**

### Limitations
- Accuracy depends on image quality and lighting
- Some rare conditions may not be accurately classified
- Model performance varies across different skin types
- Results are probabilistic and not definitive

### Best Practices
- Use clear, well-lit images
- Ensure good image resolution
- Include the affected area clearly
- Avoid shadows and reflections
- Use consistent lighting conditions

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA/GPU Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Install CPU-only TensorFlow
   pip install tensorflow-cpu
   ```

2. **Memory Issues**:
   - Reduce batch size in `skin_disease_model.py`
   - Use smaller image size
   - Close other applications

3. **Model Not Found**:
   - Ensure you've trained the model first
   - Check file path in `app.py`

4. **Dataset Issues**:
   - Verify folder structure matches expected format
   - Ensure all categories have images
   - Check file permissions
